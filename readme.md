#SRobo2013 Scorer

This is a script to do scores for the [Student Robotics](http://srobo.org) 2013
game entitled 'A Strange Game'. To use it edit the `tokens.yml` file
(or create & modify a copy, and pass the name as the only command line argument)
with some
token counts (or the letter 'p' if the robot put a token on a pedestal) and then
run the script. It'll spit some scores out for you.
